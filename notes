How higher level, how slower countdown
Invalid program runs on lowest level (fastest countdown)

stack only 1 int big
heap contains key-value as string-int

Every output stands for 7 segmenten display.

Implement stack pointer.
if just move stack pointer by 1 if false
Implement jump
jump to line

Statement has access (while compiling) to the line number.
LABEL register line number of itself to heap with name <label name> during build. Label name must start with _
GOTO sets current PROGRAM_COUNTER to _R and jumps to label or address
MEM_RESET resets heap (handy while in Interpreter)
MEM_DUMP
RETURN will get the _R from heap and jump to is
